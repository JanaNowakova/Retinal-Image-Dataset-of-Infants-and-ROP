# Retinal-Image-Dataset-of-Infants-and-ROP
Retinopathy, a term generally used to indicate a retinal involvement, is well-known and well-described, often associated with diabetes mellitus as one of the most concomitant diseases, affecting up to 80\% of people with diabetes. Datasets and computer-aided approaches for processing and classifying "classic" retinopathy images connected mainly with adult people are available. Nevertheless, retinopathy connected with diabetes is not the only type of retinopathy. A serious childhood ocular disease is the retinopathy of prematurely born infants - Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP). As the name suggests, ROP is an illness, especially in newborns and infants. The situation around eye retina images of infants emphasising prematurely born infants differs from "classic" retinopathy datasets. It is not accompanied by huge and available datasets and methods for processing. The paper proposes a unique, free-for-non-commercional usage dataset of 6,004 retinal images of 188 newborns, most of whom are prematurely born infants. The dataset is prepared for the extension and represents a great basis for developing algorithms to diagnose retinal diseases in children.
